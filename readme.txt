X-Wing Miniatures game tournament organizer

This is a simple program for running a standard tournament for the X-Wing Miniatures Game. It follows Fantasy Flight's tournament rules regarding scoring and margin of victory (MOV). The initial pairing is random with a dummy user (called 'Bye') added in the event of an odd number of players. Subsequent pairings follow standard Swiss-system pairings with the option of manually re-doing the pairings before every round. This is to ensure that the same player doesn't get a bye multiple times, for instance, and that two players don't play against each other multiple times (as per FF's tournament rules).

If there are an odd number of players the player who has a 'Bye' has their score automatically calculated.

This program can be adapted to other two-player games which use a Swiss-system tornament format.
