X-Wing Miniatures game tournament organizer

This is a simple program for running a standard tournament for the X-Wing Miniatures Game. It follows Fantasy Flight's tournament rules regarding scoring and margin of victory (MOV). The initial pairing is random with a dummy user (called 'Bye') added in the event of an odd number of players. Subsequent pairings follow standard Swiss-system pairings with the option of manually re-doing the pairings before every round. This is to ensure that the same player doesn't get a bye multiple times, for instance, and that two players don't play against each other multiple times (as per FF's tournament rules).

Note that if a player has a bye, they recieve a victory with a margin of 50 points (so when entering ship points for a player with a bye, the player recieves 100 points and the 'Bye' player recieves 50 points).

This program can be adapted to other two-player games which use a Swiss-system tornament format.
