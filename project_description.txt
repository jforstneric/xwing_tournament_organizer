X-Wing Miniatures game tournament organizer


The plan is to have a program which we can use to run an X-Wing miniatures tournament using Swiss-style rounds as per FF tournament regulations.

Steps of the program:

1. Enter all participants. Something along the lines of 'enter participant or press enter if you're done'. Check if we have even or odd number, if odd, add a 'bye' participant. Write participants to a list (?)

2. Ask how many rounds we'll play. -> 'rounds'

3. Create random pairings. Possibly export pairings (with a name of 'first round'?

4. Write in results - tournament points and MOV (margin of victory) - this second are for tie-breaking. Show results and ask for confirmation before continuing or allow organizer to enter results again.

5. Sort the players according to results, create new pairings (this time first two, next two, etc). 

Repeat steps 4 and 5 for number of rounds.

Print out winner, number of points and MOV, also export to file.


1. Each participant needs 3 fields: Name, Points, MOV.

MOV: 

mov = p1 score - p2 score

p1_mov = mov + 100
p2_mov = 100 - mov

IF P1_mov ==
